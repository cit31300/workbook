# Open VS Code
VS Code allows you to create and edit the files needed for your web applications and includes a built-in terminal that allows you to execute the commands needed to run your Node.js server.

1. Open Visual Studio code.

2. Under the Terminal menu, select **New Terminal**.

You will see the command prompt of the Linux operating system. The Terminal is where you will execute commands.

3. In the Terminal, use the `cd` and `ls` commands to navigate to the directory where you will store your project files. You will create a new top-level directory for each project in this course.

4. Create a new top level directory for our `hello-express` project and move into that directory.

```
mkdir hello-express && cd hello-express
```
