# Make a Request of Your Web Application

You now have a server that is running and waiting for requests. 

1. Make a request of your server by going to a new browser window on the same computer and visit the URL: [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

This is the IP address and port number that is listening for requests, which you set in your code.
