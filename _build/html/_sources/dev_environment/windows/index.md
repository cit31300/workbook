# Your Windows Development Environment

You will work on your local computer to develop the web applications we will build this semester.

Although Windows Server can host many types of web applications, the work we will perform in this class assumes that your application will be hosted on a Linux-based server.

You will install a virtual machine that runs the Ubuntu distribution of Linux on your local computer.

```{important}
Your Windows OS MUST be Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11!!

If your OS does not meet this threshold, you MUST update your operating system!

If you are unable to update or your computer is not able to run this version of Windows, consult with the instructor for options.
