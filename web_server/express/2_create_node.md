# Create a Node.js File with Express
You will now create a new file from the Linux command prompt and open it for editing in Visual Studio Code.

1. Install **express* by entering the following command into the Terminal

```
npm install express --save
```

```{note}
Remember! `npm` stands for Node.js Package Manager. This is the utility that helps us install and manage other Node.js tools we will incorporate into our applications.
```

2. Ensure that you are in the directory for our `hello-express` project and enter the following into the Terminal:

```
code app.js -r
```

```{note}
Note: the -r may not be necessary on Windows machines, but it will not hurt anything.
```

You should now see an empty text file in the Visual Studio Code editor.

2. **Save this file** (with no content)

3. Verify that you see the file you just created in the Terminal by typing the following command:

```
ls
```

You should see a single file in this directory named `app.js`.
