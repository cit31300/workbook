# Create a Node.js File
You will now create a new file from the Linux command prompt and open it for editing in Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure that you are in the directory for our `hello-node` project and enter the following into the Terminal:

```
code hellonode.js -r
```

```{note}
Note: the -r may not be necessary on Windows machines, but it will not hurt anything.
```

You should now see an empty text file in the Visual Studio Code editor.

2. **Save this file** (with no content)

3. Verify that you see the file you just created in the Terminal by typing the following command:

```
ls
```

You should see a single file in this directory named `hellonode.js`.
