# Install Visual Studio Code

All demonstrations and videos this semester will use Visual Studio Code as the IDE (integrated development environment). I strongly urge you to use VS Code for your own development â€“ it has Git integration, code highlighting and syntax, and a built-in terminal that will help you run your web applications locally.

`````{admonition} Pro Tip!
:class: tip

Visual Studio **Code** is a free, open-source code editor. It is different from the complete Visual Studio package.

You'll often see it referred to as "VS Code" or just "Code", but it should not be confused with Visual Studio.

## Install Visual Studio Code

1. If you have not already, [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Choose the correct version for your **Windows** version and chipset.

```{note}
Although we just installed Ubuntu/Linux as your operating system, you will install Visual Studio Code as a **Windows** application! (See below.)

## Install VS Code WSL Extension

Microsoft has created an extension for VS Code that allows your Windows application to interact with files in your Ubuntu instance. 

1. Visit the [WSL Extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) and click the green Install button.

```{note}
You may automatically be prompted to install the Extension by Visual Studio Code. If so, you may install it from the prompt. It's the same extension as listed above.
