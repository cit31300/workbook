# Your MacOS Development Environment

You will work on your local computer to develop the web applications we will build this semester.

The work we will perform in this class assumes that your application will be hosted on a Linux-based server. MacOS is based on Linux, so you can natively install all of the software that you'll need to develop the applications in this course.
